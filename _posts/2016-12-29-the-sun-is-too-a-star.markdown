## Hello, World!
I'm so excited to join this community in which people all over,
through the power of the web, can record and publish their interests for others
to share; in other words, I'm happy to join the blogging community!

<blockquote>
Some believed her dull,<br>
If right I do recall,<br>
They said that she was hard to please,<br>
Unmoved by pleasureâ€™s thrall.<br>
Yet I realize now, as I look back,<br>
They hadn't really sought,<br>
For the things that made her smile<br>
Were much smaller than they thought<br>

Like a glimmering star,<br>
Its flash of light beyond the moon,<br>
The first smile of a newborn child,<br>
A sky glittering of pink hues,<br>
The tremble of a mounding tear,<br>
The ripple of a hearty laugh,<br>
The sun on breezy afternoons,<br>
Sweet memories of summers past.<br>

She'd learnt treasures far, possessions great,<br>
Dull the sparkle of each common day,<br>
For only the spoiled fail to see the sun<br>
When the other stars have passed away.
