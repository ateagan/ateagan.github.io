poem: |-
  Some believed her dull,
  If right I do recall,
  They said that she was hard to please,
  Unmoved by pleasure’s thrall.
  Yet I realize now, as I look back,
  They hadn't really sought,
  For the things that made her smile
  Were much smaller than they thought

  Like a glimmering star,
  Its flash of light beyond the moon,
  The first smile of a newborn child,
  A sky glittering of pink hues,
  The tremble of a mounding tear,
  The ripple of a hearty laugh,
  The sun on breezy afternoons,
  Sweet memories of summers past.

  She'd learnt treasures far, possessions great,
  Dull the sparkle of each common day,
  For only the spoiled fail to see the sun
  When the other stars have passed away.
