## Storms

<blockquote>
Perhaps a little storm isn’t so bad as it seems,<br>
For lightning does light up the sky once far too dark to see.<br>
And hear the mighty thunder roar! So fearful be the sound,<br>
Yet melancholy and serene as it shakes the very ground.<br>
And the pitter-patter of the rain falling in rhythms, patterns, beats,<br>
Washing out the musky air, clearing out the heat.<br>
Maybe storms frighten the being of a child,<br>
but to me offers moments sweet in a world that’s turning wild.
