## Storms
Perhaps a little storm isn’t so bad as it seems,  
For lightning does light up the sky once far too dark to see.  
And hear the mighty thunder roar! So fearful be the sound,  
Yet melancholy and serene as it shakes the very ground.  
And the pitter-patter of the rain falling in rhythms, patterns, beats,  
Washing out the musky air, clearing out the heat.  
Maybe storms frighten the being of a child,  
but to me offers moments sweet in a world that’s turning wild.
